## Project 1 -- Song Library
Song Library is a simple desktop application that simulates the use of a song library.
The point of this is to get our feet wet in using JavaFX and its features. It can not
actually store songs or play any type of music. It simply holds the names of songs and
saves that data to disk for future sessions.

## Project 2 -- Chess
This project is a terminal based game of Chess. There is no GUI. The board and pieces
are all written out using ASCII characters. User input and game output is all done through
the terminal. The point of this project was to practice types of OO concepts such as
dynamic binding, inheritance, etc.

## Project 3 -- Photo Library for Desktop
This project is a fully working photo library for the desktop. Unlike song library, where
most of the features were just for show and testing purposes, this could be used as
an actual application. It features:

- Login Controls
- Admin Control Panel
- Storing photos within albums
- Adding tags to photos and searching by tags
- A built in slideshow

## Project 4 -- Photo Library for Android
This project is a port of the photo library for desktop onto android. However, for the sake
of time constraints during the semester, we were instructed to strip some of the features out.
This led to the removal of the login screen and does not allow the user to add their own custom
tags. Nonetheless, it still works well enough for the job at hand.
